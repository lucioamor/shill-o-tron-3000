  <h1>Shill-O-Tron 3000 - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy for Shill-O-Tron 3000, a proof-of-concept Chrome extension designed to zap sneaky shillers on Reddit! This policy explains how we handle data while enhancing your Reddit experience in a humorous, experimental way. We value your privacy and comply with the Chrome Web Store Program Policies and Reddit User Agreement.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following data to provide our shill detection functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication Data</strong>: A Reddit access token is collected via OAuth with your consent. This token is stored locally in Chrome’s storage and used to fetch comment data from Reddit’s API. We do not access passwords or other credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Website Content</strong>: Public comment data from Reddit threads (e.g., text, hyperlinks) is temporarily processed in real-time to detect repetitive link promotion. This data is not stored beyond your session.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal identification information (e.g., name, email), health data, financial data, personal communications, location, web history, or user activity beyond Reddit comments.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>Data is used solely for the extension’s single purpose: detecting potential shillers by analyzing link patterns in Reddit comments. The access token enables API requests, and comment data is processed to flag suspicious activity with a playful interface. No data is used for purposes unrelated to this goal, such as determining credibility or lending.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, transfer, or share your data with third parties, except as required by law or Reddit’s API terms (e.g., during OAuth authentication). All data processing occurs locally on your device, ensuring your privacy.</p>

  <h2>Transparency and Compliance</h2>
  <p>Our algorithm is fully transparent, with source code available <a href="https://github.com/lucioamor/shill-o-tron-3000" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. We only use permissions necessary for our experimental purpose (e.g., Reddit API access via OAuth). See the <a href="permissions.html" target="_blank">Permissions Explained</a> for details.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>By installing Shill-O-Tron 3000, you consent to this data usage. You can revoke access by uninstalling the extension, which removes the locally stored access token. No data persists after uninstallation.</p>
