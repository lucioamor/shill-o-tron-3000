  <h1>Shill-O-Tron 3000 - Legal Disclaimer</h1>
  <p>Shill-O-Tron 3000 is a proof-of-concept Chrome extension developed in good faith as a humorous, experimental tool to enhance the Reddit experience. It is not a commercial product, and no claims are made regarding the accuracy, reliability, or legal validity of its shill detection algorithm. The extension’s functionality—identifying link patterns via Reddit’s API with user consent—is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
  
  <p>The algorithm is fully transparent, with source code available <a href="https://github.com/lucioamor/shill-o-tron-3000" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>, and operates solely to flag potential link promotion based on publicly accessible comment data. It is not designed, intended, or capable of promoting inequality, discrimination, or harm, and its use is intended solely for entertainment and community improvement. The developer disclaims all liability for any misidentification, user interpretation, or third-party actions resulting from its use.</p>
  
  <p>This extension complies with the Chrome Web Store Program Policies and Reddit User Agreement, utilizing only permissions necessary for its experimental purpose (e.g., Reddit API access via OAuth). The developer claims no right, title, or interest in any trademarks, service marks, or intellectual property of Reddit, Chrome, or any third party, and this extension does not imply endorsement by or affiliation with such entities.</p>
  
  <p>Users are encouraged to review the <a href="permissions.html" target="_blank">Permissions Explained</a> and <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. By installing, you agree that the developer assumes no responsibility for legal, ethical, or social consequences, with all use at your own risk.
